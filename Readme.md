## 🐣 Project Overview

🌷 This is a **collaboration project** with [@bimaadam](https://github.com/bimaadam) to help bring digital transformation to a financial management system used by a growing industrial service company in Indonesia 🇮🇩

I mainly supported the UI/UX side, ensuring clean components, smooth interactions, and an aesthetic layout using Tailwind CSS + Next.js 🌸

> "Because clean UI isn't just for the eyes, but for the soul too 💫"
